        <h1>Office 365</h1>
        <p>The easiest way to get started with Excel, is to use Office 365.

Office 365 does not require downloading and installation of the program. It simply runs in your browser.

In our tutorial we will use Office 365, which can be accessed from www.office.com.</p>

            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>This chapter is about giving you an overview of Excel. Excel's structure is made of two pieces, the Ribbon and the Sheet.

Have a look at the picture below. The Ribbon is marked with a red rectangle and the Sheet is marked with a yellow rectangle:</p>

          <h1>Syntax</h1>
          <p>A formula in Excel is used to do mathematical calculations. Formulas always start with the equal sign = typed in the cell, followed by your calculation.</p>
          <p><b>Note:</b> You claim the cell by selecting it and typing the equal sign (=)</p>
          <h1>Creating formulas, step by step</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Select a cell</li>
            <li>Type the equal sign (=)</li>
            <li>Select a cell or type value</li>
            <li>Enter an arithmetic operator</li>
            <li>Select another cell or type value</li>
            <li>Press enter</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For example =1+1 is the formula to calculate <b>1+1=2</b></p>

          <h1>Formatting</h1>
          <p>Excel has many ways to format and style a spreadsheet.

</p>
<p>Why format and style your spreadsheet?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make it easier to read and understand</li>
   <li>Make it more delicate</li>
</ul>
<p>Styling is about changing the looks of cells, such as changing colors, font, font sizes, borders, number formats, and so on.</p>
<p>The most used styling functions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Colors</li>
  <li>Fonts</li>
  <li>Borders</li>
  <li>Number formats</li>
  <li>Grids</li>
</ul>

          <h1>Excel Sort</h1>
          <p>Ranges can be sorted using the <b>Sort Ascending</b> and <b>Sort Descending</b> commands.</p>
          <p><b>Sort Ascending:</b> from smallest to largest.</p>
          <p><b>Sort Descending:</b> from largest to smallest.</p>
          <p>The sort commands work for text too, using A-Z order.</p>
          <p><b>Note:</b> To sort a range that has more than one column, the whole range has to be selected. Sorting just one can breaks the relationship between columns.

This is shown in an example later in this chapter.</p>

          <p>PivotTable is a functionality in Excel which helps you organize and analyze data.

It lets you add and remove values, perform calculations, and to filter and sort data sets.

          <h1>How a PivotTable Works</h1>
          <p>PivotTables have four main components:</p>
          <ul>
            <ol>1. Columns</ol>
            <p>Columns are vertical tabular data.

The column includes the unique header, which is on the top.

The header defines which data you are seeing listed downwards.

In this example, D5(Sum of Attack) is the header.</p>

It is typed =AVERAGEIF and has three parts:</p>
